# Multiplayer-Game-on-a-board
A 2 player Game. Where players move on grid and collect items that give them score. This movement of players are done from the same system through multi-threading concepts.

This has to run on **Linux based systems** through the terminal.

This has been done without use of mutex's (even though you might see them initialized in the code), instead a queue has been made which works just as a mutex (kind of)
